## About Application

This project aims to enhance the Image Recognition capabilities of our application called Aseupan. We will be using the Node.js environment to build a REST API and integrate it with cloud vision services.

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust Image Recognition feature that can accurately identify and analyze images uploaded by users. By leveraging the power of cloud vision services, we can tap into advanced algorithms and machine learning models to perform tasks such as object detection, image classification, and image annotation.

Our REST API will provide endpoints for users to upload images and receive detailed information and insights about the content of those images. The Node.js environment offers scalability, flexibility, and a wide range of libraries and frameworks that will facilitate the development and deployment of the API.

By integrating cloud vision services, we can offload the heavy computational tasks required for image recognition to a scalable and reliable infrastructure. This will ensure that our application can handle large volumes of image processing requests efficiently and deliver accurate results in a timely manner.

Overall, this project will significantly enhance the user experience of Aseupan by providing powerful Image Recognition features. It will enable users to gain valuable insights from their images and automate various tasks based on the content of those images. Through the use of Node.js and cloud vision services, we can build a high-performing and scalable REST API that meets the demands of our application
